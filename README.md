# Risk Adjusted Outcomes

Specific Aims
	Dramatic shifts in the health care landscape spurred by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, along with policies linking reimbursement rates with quality of care, are driving stakeholders to more closely assess the value and efficiency of health care delivery. Efforts to compare outcomes among hospitals and providers are dependent on accurate risk-adjustment, given widely varying patient characteristics, disease severity, and referral patterns. However, traditional risk-adjustment methods have focused on disease severity and comorbidities (1,2). Many modeling strategies have been employed, but use the same core severity and comorbidity metrics (3,4). More recent work has demonstrated close associations between social determinants of health and increased 30-day readmissions (5), yet payers are moving forward with plans to execute risk-adjusted quality ratings without consideration of these additional factors, which may adversely affect quality ratings for safety net hospitals. 
	We will combine population-based data with hospital-specific factors and patient-level clinical factors to develop a comprehensive risk-adjustment system for patients undergoing surgery for urologic malignancies. We hypothesize that incorporating data regarding patient social determinants of health, such as ethnicity, income, education level, neighborhood factors, and healthcare access into existing risk-adjustment models can provide more accurate assessment of the quality of care delivered by hospitals.

# Specific Aim 1
Identify social determinants of health that are associated with 30-day readmission rates in patients undergoing urologic surgery.
Hypothesis: Social determinants of health such as ethnicity, income, education levels, neighborhood factors, and healthcare access, are associated with 30-day readmission rates after urologic cancer surgery.

# Specific Aim 2
Develop hierarchical multivariate statistical models to predict 30-day readmission rates in urologic patients that combine social, hospital-specific, and patient clinical factors, while using advanced econometric analytic techniques to quantify improvement in model performance when adding social determinants of health data.
Hypothesis: Multilevel models that combine social determinants of health data with clinical, hospital, and population data provide more accurate risk-adjustment and prediction of 30-day readmission rates than those that do not.

# Specific Aim 3
Measure statistical model discrimination and predictive ability with the addition of social factors when compared to current risk-adjustment systems that do not incorporate social factors, using novel econometric techniques. 
Hypothesis: The addition of social determinants of health to pre-existing risk-adjustment models provides more accurate real-world outcome measures and higher model discriminating ability.

To date, no work has attempted to incorporate population level social determinants of health into risk-adjustment models for urologic patients. With increased political and financial pressures to improve outcomes, accurate risk-adjustment is instrumental in appropriately adjusting reimbursement rates and comparing hospital performance.
